## Info
This is a small project completed for the Codecademy Full Stack career path course. The brief states that the project must output a random message on a topic of your choosing using at least 3 pieces of data.

I chose video game reviews as my topic and used 4 variables in order to construct the message:
Variable | Example
--- | ---
A video game | Minecraft, Doom
A word describing the game | fun, boring, mediocre
A judgement of the game | It might be the best game I've ever played
A score out of 10 | 1/10, 5/10, 10/10

I used an HTML page, a button, and some simple CSS styling to display the random reviews.
